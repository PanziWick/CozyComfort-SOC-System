# CozyComfort SOC System

## Overview
This project implements a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOC)** solution for "Cozy Comfort," a blanket manufacturer that interacts with distributors and sellers.  
The system modernizes their order and inventory processes by introducing:
- A **Central API (ASP.NET Core Web API)** for all business logic and database access
- **Manufacturer Desktop App (Windows Forms)** to manage blanket production
- **Distributor Web App (ASP.NET MVC)** to manage distributor inventory and seller orders
- **Seller Web App (ASP.NET MVC)** to manage seller orders and stock

---

## üéØ Features
- **Manufacturer**: Manage blankets, update production stock
- **Distributor**: View inventory, approve/ship seller orders, request stock
- **Seller**: Place orders, track order statuses, manage inventory
- Built on **.NET 8, EF Core, SQL Server**, and containerized for deployment

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows SOC:
- Clients (Desktop/Web) communicate with a **central API** only.
- **API handles DB interactions** via Entity Framework Core.
- Independent modules for **Manufacturer**, **Distributor**, and **Seller** services.
